## About Me
Hi! I'm Ena, a junior studying Computer Science at **San JosÃ© State University**.  I'm passionate about AI/ML and building human-centered, inclusive tech. Most recently, I interned at **Google Cloud**, where I helped build an **Agentic AI security system** focused on dynamic vulnerability scanning within GCP, which you can read more about [here](https://github.com/jasminetntu/multiagent-security-gcp).
- I'm especially interested in the intersection of **AI**, **cybersecurity**, and **sustainability**. These are areas where I hope to grow my experience and impact.
- I love learning and collaborating with others to tackle challenging projects!

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Java, Python
- **Data Science and ML**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, Hugging Face
- **Tools**: Github, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Google Cloud Platform

## Featured Projects

### [Agent-Powered Vulnerability Scanner for Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/jasminetntu/multiagent-security-gcp)
> Google Cloud

A modular, multi-agent system that utilizes Google ADK and [refactored Cloudsploit](https://github.com/amanshresthaatgoogle/cloudsploit) to run dynamic cloud security scans.
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Google Cloud Functions, Google Agent Development Kit, Python, Javascript
- **What I learned**: Agent powered systems and architecture, cloud products and architecture
  
### [Skin Condition Classifier](https://github.com/enamacahiya/Equitable-AI-for-Derm-Competition)
> Kaggle x Algorithmic Justice League x Break Through Tech AI

Trained ResNet-50 classifier and Google Derm Foundation model to classify 21 different skin conditions across 6 Fitzpatrick skin tones.
- Goal of improving model performance on darker skin tones, which were underrepresented in the dataset
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Google Colab, ResNet-50, Google Derm Foundation Model, Hugging Face
- **What I learned**: Image Classification, computer vision, data augmentation, responsible AI

### [AI-Powered Chat Summarization](https://github.com/megaDeathChav/asapp-project/tree/main) 
> ASAPP x Break Through Tech AI

Turned unstructured conversational data into structured JSON data using LLMs to extract meaningful customer insights.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Google Colab, BERT, Gemini, Llama, scikit-learn
- **What I learned**: LLM pipelines, text preprocessing, customer intent summarization

## Other Projects
- [Stock Price Prediction (S&P 500)](https://github.com/enamacahiya/stock-price-prediction-sp500): Regression models for financial time series using scikit-learn, XGBoost, and CNN-LSTM.  
- [Spartan Personal Budgeting](https://github.com/enamacahiya/spartan-personal-budgeting): Web budgeting app built as a full-stack Java project for SJSU CS151.
